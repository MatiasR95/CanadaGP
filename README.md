# 🏁 Canadian GP SQL Analysis – Franco Colapinto Strategy

## Overview
This project delivers a targeted SQL-driven breakdown of approximately 43 Canadian Grand Prix (1978–2024), with an emphasis on preparing Franco Colapinto for his 2025 F1 challenge. Built to practice advanced SQL techniques (CTEs, window functions, date/time logic), the project includes strategic grids, overtaking metrics, qualifying and constructor insights, and point probability modeling.

## Objectives
- **Exploratory**: Map F1 history at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve—wins, poles, constructors.
- **Practice Tasks**: Refine SQL skills with drills on aggregates, window functions, and temporal calculations.
- **Journalism Tasks**: Surface narrative driving data—overtaking frequency, position dynamics, constructor impact.
- **Strategy**: Guide real-world decisions: grid position’s impact on point scoring, qualifying strategy for Colapinto.

## Highlights
| Insight                   | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| 🏆 Hamilton & Schumacher | Tied with 7 wins each at Canadian GP—historical dominance. |
| 🎖 Poles (2004–2024)     | Identifies top qualifiers shaping grid strategies. |
| 🛣 Overtake Patterns     | Reveals mid-race position volatility since the hybrid era. |
| 🏭 Constructor Consistency | Examines team legacies and reliability across decades. |
| 📈 Points by Grid        | Demonstrates strong probability of scoring when starting top-8. |
| ↗️ Position Dynamics     | Tracks average gains/losses per grid slot over recent seasons. |

## Why This Project
The goal isn’t only to support Colapinto’s performance strategy—it’s to showcase that thoughtful SQL work can turn raw data into clear, actionable insights. That’s critical in any analyst role.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repo.
2. Run all `.sql` scripts in sequence.
3. Export results to `/results/`.
4. View the 6-page summary in `/docs/CanvaReport.pdf`.

## Next Steps
- Incorporate live race data for real-time dashboards.
- Combine weather and pit-stop data for richer race predictions.
- Expand the analysis to other circuits.
